<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>Name: Darren Miral<br>
Student Number: s3858795<br>
email: darren.miral@gmail.com or s3858795@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
Background Information: I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia to Sri Lankan immigrants.  While I have never lived outside of Melbourne, I have travelled to a number of countries including the US, Canada, the UK and a number of countries in Central Europe <br> 
I completed in High School 2006 and obtained a Bachelors Degree in Medicine from Monash University in 2012.  I stopped working as a doctor after feeling a burnt out, tired of dealing with large numbers of strangers every day and unsure if it was the career I wanted.<br>
I have an intellectual curiosity regarding a number of subjects such as history, astronomy, chemistry and fine art and love quiz shows.  The National Football League (the major professional American football league) is also a significant interest of mine, and it is quite common for me to be awake before dawn on Monday mornings during the season to watch my team play.</p>

<h3> Interest in IT</h3>

<h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
<p>My interest in IT stems from an interest in video games and enjoying researching various computers and computer components.  I also enjoy occasionally troubleshooting issues as they arise, both in the context of IT and elsewhere.  My interest in video games began when I was in primary school and learnt how to use a GameBoy emulator on my PC to play Pokemon, which was quite exciting as I didn’t have a GameBoy myself, and continued through various strategy games such as WarCraft 2, Age of Empires and Starcraft during my teenage years.  I have also developed a bit of an interesting in computer programming through downloading and occasionally minorly manipulating mods of games in recent years.  Beyond building my own PC, servicing various laptop computers I’ve owned through school and university and setting up a NAS to store multimedia files, I have very little IT experience.</p>
