<h1>COSC2196 Assignment 01</h1>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>Name: Darren Miral<br>
Student Number: s3858795<br>
email: darren.miral@gmail.com or s3858795@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
Background Information: I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia to Sri Lankan immigrants.  While I have never lived outside of Melbourne, I have travelled to a number of countries including the US, Canada, the UK and a number of countries in Central Europe <br> 
I completed in High School 2006 and obtained a Bachelors Degree in Medicine from Monash University in 2012.  I stopped working as a doctor after feeling a burnt out, tired of dealing with large numbers of strangers every day and unsure if it was the career I wanted.<br>
I have an intellectual curiosity regarding a number of subjects such as history, astronomy, chemistry and fine art and love quiz shows.  The National Football League (the major professional American football league) is also a significant interest of mine, and it is quite common for me to be awake before dawn on Monday mornings during the season to watch my team play.</p>

<h3> Interest in IT</h3>

<h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
<p>My interest in IT stems from an interest in video games and enjoying researching various computers and computer components.  I also enjoy occasionally troubleshooting issues as they arise, both in the context of IT and elsewhere.  My interest in video games began when I was in primary school and learnt how to use a GameBoy emulator on my PC to play Pokemon, which was quite exciting as I didn’t have a GameBoy myself, and continued through various strategy games such as WarCraft 2, Age of Empires and Starcraft during my teenage years.  I have also developed a bit of an interesting in computer programming through downloading and occasionally minorly manipulating mods of games in recent years.  Beyond building my own PC, servicing various laptop computers I’ve owned through school and university and setting up a NAS to store multimedia files, I have very little IT experience.</p>

<h4> Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
<p>I chose RMIT for both intellectual and practical reasons.  The intellectual reasons were two-fold.  The reputation of the university as one of the better ones in the country, and one of the top ones in the state was the first.  The second was due to reading from past students that RMIT provides more practical teaching than some other institutions and has a positive reputation within industry, which should theoretically help with finding employment in the future.  The practical reason for studying at RMIT was that I live in Melbourne, which is obviously where RMIT is based.</p>

<h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
<p>Learning programming skills, the installation and management of IT networks and equipment and potentially learning about cyber security were the major areas I hoped to learn from my time at RMIT.  I also expected that there would be some software and website development to be learnt in this course.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<p>As someone with no formal experience in the IT industry, the job description for a Network Engineer (Network Engineer job description and duties | Robert Half, 2020) sounds appealing.  Designing, installing and configuring network equipment sounds like a good mix of hands-on work while also requiring significant thought and planning, things I believe to be my strengths.  I enjoy problem solving, and this appears to also be a significant aspect of the job.<br>
This job advertisement I’ve chosen <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41134226">is the following:</a> <br>

<p>In order to be qualified for a similar job to this, I believe it will require 5+ years of learning and on the job experience, beginning with this course.<br>
The Bachelor of IT offered by RMIT through Open Universities Australia requires four electives to be completed.  After examining the Degree Guide, I believe that the following electives would probably be the most relevant in furthering me towards this career: Unix System Administration (CPT264); Programming Principles 2A (CPT 220); Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (CPT323); and Cloud Computing (CPT350).<br>
Beyond this degree, it is clear that further certification is required (How to Become a Network Engineer, 2020) beginning with CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) or similar such as JNCIA – Junos which I believe to be a similar certification using competing equipment.  Other certifications such as the Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) certification in Windows Server 2016 and IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) certifications could also be of use, while this job in particular would also require the Palo Alto Networks Certified Cybersecurity Associate (PCCSA) certification at a minimum – or more likely the more advanced Palo Alto Networks Certified Network Security Administrator (PCNSA) certification. <br>
As I have none of these qualifications or certifications, they would be completed either just before or during working as a network administrator to gain experience before being seen as qualified to be hired as a Network Engineer.<br>
